Elizabethton Counseling and Arts Center, PLLC provides individual and group therapy options that use treatment goals that are client-focused and centered on the individual experience to bring growth and transformation to the individual. Using empirically evidenced therapy, we work to help the client understand their past, focus on the present, and continue towards the future. With over 50 years of combined therapeutic experience, we offer a variety of experiences and opportunities for all ages.  

We currently offer both in-person and online HIPPA compliant telehealth options to better meet your needs!
