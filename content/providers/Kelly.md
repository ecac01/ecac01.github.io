Kelly Thomas, LMFT  
Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist

E-Mail: [kelly@elizabethtoncac.com](kelly@elizabethtoncac.com)  

I am licensed in the states of Tennessee and North Carolina as a Marriage and Family Therapist. With over 16 years in the field, I have experience working with children, adolescents, and adults in various stages of their journey. I am a trained practitioner in TBRI (Trust Based Relational Intervention) and am passionate about helping families connect, communicate, and help each other grow. I hold a Master's Degree in Counseling from ETSU and have also been trained in behavioral modification techniques through Florida Institute of Technology.

I offer a safe, accepting and non-judgmental environment for my clients. There is nothing too big or too small to bring into the counseling space to explore and navigate together. My areas of knowledge are anxiety, depression, ADHD, trauma, grief, family issues, parenting issues /coaching, low self-esteem and adjustment issues. I currently work with clients ages 12 and up, utilizing a Cognitive/Behavioral approach while including relevant techniques for the individual's needs.

I've grown up here in East Tennessee and love my community and its people! Please reach out to me so I can walk your healing path with you.
