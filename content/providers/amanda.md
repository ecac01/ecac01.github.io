> Living your life, with all of its glory and tragedy, sometimes begs for help along the way, asking for guidance, and that's why I'm here.

I am an experienced Licensed Professional Counselor in TN, HeartMath Certified Practitioner and a Certified Forest Therapy Guide by the Association of Nature and Forest Therapy (ANFT). I've devoted my life's work to providing a presence, a listening ear, and an objective voice for support and guidance, both within a traditional counseling setting indoors, as well as outdoors in the Appalachian Mountains. I am able to assist with life adjustments, setting healthy boundaries, dealing with loss of all types, and learning new perspectives and strategies.  

For almost 30 years having worked in a variety of backgrounds, I have been committed to helping people of all walks of life deal with depression, anxiety, stress, loss, and life transitions. I work primarily with adults, and my areas of specialty include Self-Discovery, Recovery from Codependency, Stress Management, and Walk and Talk Therapy. Often taking the first step can be the hardest part, especially during times when we feel overwhelmed, depressed, anxious, or grief-stricken, and I would be honored to assist you if you so choose. I work in collaboration with my clients, focusing on goals that one can grow, such as self-worth, healthy relationships, body positivity, a unique voice, and a meaningful purpose. I believe that we are far more capable than we realize, that we hold the key, and I will strive to help you remember that.  

In addition to being a Licensed Professional Counselor, I am a Certified HeartMath Practitioner, as well as a Certified Forest Therapy Guide by the Association of Nature and Forest Therapy (ANFT). I am currently certified in CPR and Wilderness First Aid, and I see clients within a traditional office setting, or in nature settings via Walk and Talk Therapy.  I practice non-judgment, acceptance, and offer a safe environment. I understand and acknowledge the vulnerability that is often present in my counseling space, and I wish to honor that. I'm far from perfect, but I try to continually work on myself in the areas of physical, mental, emotional, social, and spiritual realms of health, in order that I may be of the best help for you!  

Having spent most of my life in the Appalachian Mountains, I love to help my fellow Humans encounter wholeness and well-being by way of embodiment and nature connection practices in the More Than Human World. With all of modern life's distractions and non-stop activity, simply being, which may mean stillness or moving slowly in nature, can open the senses and deepen the relationship with one's self and with others, ultimately enhancing health and happiness. Being in nature's world may bring a sense of relief from all the everyday stresses of life, connect us, and begin to fill our hearts with light and love for ourselves and the world around us.
