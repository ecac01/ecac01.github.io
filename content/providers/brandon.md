> The future is unwritten ~ Joe Strummer

I believe there is so much power in these words! The fact that, while I may have difficulties and hurts that have and/or continue to add unwanted weight to my journey, every second is a new and potential step toward a day and life well-lived!

I am a Tennessee State Licensed Professional Counselor and Mental Health Service Provider with a passion for the privilege of journeying with others through difficulties. I founded what is now Elizabethton Counseling and Arts Center in 2014. Over the past decade, we have grown and continue to grow into a small practice focused on providing a comfortable, healing and personal therapeutic environment.   

I have over 15 years of experience working with children, adolescents/teens, and adults and specialize in depression, anxiety, ADHD, trauma, obsessive-compulsive disorder, grief, lifelong illness, coupleâ€™s/family issues, low self-view, spiritual issues, behavioral issues in children, and adjustment. I currently see individuals of all ages and deeply enjoy working with a diverse population of people. I have worked as a contracted referral therapist for St Jude for over 8 years and have had experience with childhood illness through the Johnson City affiliate.   

I am existentially-focused with an eclectic theoretic approach, utilizing Acceptance and Commitment, Cognitive/Behavioral, and Exposure therapies to guide a uniquely individualized plan for each person I work with. While traditional sessions are offered, I also offer art-focused and movement-focused session work that include creating through painting, sketching, coloring, music, and a variety of other arts. I also offer different movement options that include outdoor and walking sessions.  

I strongly believe you should feel comfortable with the therapist you choose and hopeful about the therapy you receive. Engagement and alignment are the cornerstones of a thriving therapeutic process and you, the client, are the foundation and priority.  

Call, text, or email to begin your healing journey! Your future is unwritten!
