Patricia has a passion to work with individuals who have experienced trauma, depression, and anxiety. She believes we've all experienced trauma, whether it's the obvious events one would think of as trauma or the seemingly less impactful experience of not being positively encouraged as a child, or perhaps being told we won't amount to anything or even being compared to a sibling. All those events give powerful negative messages such as "I'm not good enough," "I don't deserve good things or relationships," or "My needs don't matter." Those messages sink to our core and try to tell us who we are. Hence, the reason so many people experience low self- esteem or lack of motivation to strive for healthier relationships. You may struggle to clarify why you're unhappy. Some say, "I had a good childhood" or "There wasn't anything in particular I can point to that makes me unhappy." Many report just going through the motions of daily life without feeling much joy.  

If this sounds familiar to you, there's good news! There are specialized therapies which can get to the roots of the issues, and Patricia has the training and certification in specialty therapies to get to the root, not just let some pressure off. Unless those negative messages are healed at the root, they'll resurface. Patricia excels at locating the root of the problem. In order to get the appropriate treatment that will foster long-term change and healing, the root of the problem must first be identified.  

Patricia provides a warm, welcoming environment that's nonjudgmental. She has demonstrated dedication to her clients for nearly thirty years and has seen people receive emotional healing they never thought possible.  

Patricia has a Master's degree in counseling from the University of North Carolina @ Greensboro, a program that continues to be rated in the top ten counseling programs in the nation. Additionally she obtained a Graduate Certificate in Biblical Studies from Liberty University. That combination provides for both emotional and spiritual needs to be addressed. Often, clients are surprised to discover those two areas are intertwined.  

Patricia provides a variety of treatment methods but relies heavily on EMDR therapy (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy). It's successful in treating trauma, anxiety & panic attacks, grief, low self-esteem, and depression which has been resistant to medication. Patricia is certified in EMDR therapy from the organization founded by Francine Shapiro, the developer of EMDR therapy. Patricia was trained and supervised by some of the professionals who were trained by Dr. Shapiro herself. Not only is Patricia's training and certification solid, but she has decades of experience delivering EMDR therapy shaped by some of the professionals who have authored books on the subject. This certification extends reassurance to her clients that she far surpasses the minimum training and experience to provide proven, advanced techniques to relieve symptoms of emotional distress.  

Patricia utilizes other therapies as well, including Cognitive Behavioral, Solution Focused, Gestalt, ACT, Mindfulness and Stress Management. High on her priority list is helping her clients to develop coping skills that work with their unique situations and communication styles.  

Patricia has a special interest in working with clients who struggle with treatment -resistant symptoms. Too often clients have been in therapy for years without the level of healing they hoped for. This is often a result of having the symptoms treated but never getting to the root of the problem. Patricia's approach to therapy addresses the root cause of the problem, not simply the symptoms. Treatment-resistant depression can be driven by negative self-beliefs such as "I'm not good enough," "It's my fault," or chronic regret that is stuck. When the negative messages are resolved, the depressive symptoms begin to lift. The same is true for anxiety, grief and loss, abuse and trauma, transitions in life, spiritual issues and struggles with self-forgiveness. However, the root cause of the problem must first be identified and that is an area where Patricia excels.
