I am a Tennessee State Licensed Professional Counselor and Mental Health Service Provider with a passion to help guide individuals on their journey.  I believe each individual has a unique identity and their own story in this world. It is a privilege to serve as an advocate, helping individuals and families navigate experiences in all areas of life.  

I have a Master’s degree in professional clinical mental health counseling from University of The Cumberlands and a Bachelor’s degree in English Literature from East Tennessee State University.  I am a newly licensed counselor, having 3 years of experience working with children, adolescents/teens, and adults.  I specialize in depression, anxiety, trauma, low-self view, and adjustment.  

I am existentially-focused with a holistic approach, utilizing Cognitive/Behavioral, Exposure, and Person-Centered therapies.  I offer traditional sessions, as well as art and narrative-focused sessions that promote creative healing through the mediums of writing, painting, and drawing.
